                The objective of this project is to give light to the few factors that we can see in this dataset which are a player's age,
                club, and country that they are from. From experience of just watching and playing soccer and FIFA for about 15 years now,
                I've seen common trends where once a player gets above let's say the age of 30-32, they tend to be in clubs that are not as
                popular, or even retire, etc. I always wanted to know things like which countries were best known for creating the top players
                in soccer as well as what age a typical player would be on a team. A person's age and position they play are significant factors
                on a player's body and determine how best they can play during games as well as how long they will be able to play. For example,
                one extraordinary goalkeeper by the name of Gianluigi Buffon has been able to play at the highest level for 20+ years. Now, some
                people say that it is only because he plays goalkeeper that he is able to play for the long but I believe it's still tough to be
                on your toes playing against people who are a bit more agile and might be a bit more snappy than you are on your feet. However,
                there are players like Cristiano Ronaldo who have been playing for many years at the highest level at the forward position. There
                has been a decline in his skillset and we can see that with his misplayed passes, missed goal opportunities, etc. However, his body
                is still strong and he remains sharp.
