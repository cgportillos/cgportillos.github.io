		<p><h1>Hi! My name is Carlos Portillo.</h1></p>

		<p>My motivation for choosing this project is that I have deeply enjoyed playing soccer and FIFA throughout my life. 
		   I’ve spent countless hours either on the pitch playing with teammates and on the sticks with my friends on Xbox. 
		   I know that I will enjoy making graphs, learning, and teaching what I find with this dataset.</p>
	
		<p>The objective of this project is to give light to the few factors that we can see in this dataset which are a player’s age, 
			club, and country that they are from. From experience of just watching and playing soccer and FIFA for about 15 years 
			now, I’ve seen common trends where once a player gets above let’s say the age of 30-32, they tend to be in clubs that
			are not as popular, or even retire, etc. I always wanted to know things like which countries were best known for creating 
			the top players in soccer as well as what age a typical player would be on a team. A person’s age and position they play are 
			significant factors on a player’s body and determine how best they can play during games as well as how long they will be able
			to play. For example, one extraordinary goalkeeper by the name of Gianluigi Buffon has been able to play at the highest level
			for 20+ years. Now, some people say that it is only because he plays goalkeeper that he is able to play for the long but I
			believe it’s still tough to be on your toes playing against people who are a bit more agile and might be a bit more snappy
			than you are on your feet. However, there are players like Cristiano Ronaldo who have been playing for many years at the highest
			level at the forward position. There has been a decline in his skillset and we can see that with his misplayed passes, missed
			goal opportunities, etc. However, his body is still strong and he remains sharp.</p>
